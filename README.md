# Expo Camera Preview Freeze on Android

This repository demonstrates a bug where the Expo Camera preview freezes on certain Android devices. The issue is intermittent and doesn't always produce clear error messages.

## Bug Description
The `Camera` component from Expo may fail to render correctly or freeze completely, particularly on older Android devices. The preview might become stuck on a single frame or completely blank, with no visible errors in the console.  This appears to stem from a conflict between the camera hardware and Expo's implementation under heavy resource demands.

## Reproduction
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Start the app using `expo start`.
4. Test the app on a variety of Android devices, particularly older models.

## Solution
The proposed solution involves adding error handling and implementing a retry mechanism to gracefully handle potential camera failures.  In some cases, it may be necessary to provide fallback content for the user when the camera is unavailable.  Additional performance optimizations within the Camera component may be needed to support older Android devices more effectively.   Check the `bugSolution.js` for implementation details.
